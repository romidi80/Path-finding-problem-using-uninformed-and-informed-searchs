Finding the best path in a a board game to maximize utility and time. 

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive comparison of various search algorithms, evaluating their optimality, time complexity, and memory complexity to identify the most effective solution. Our analysis begins by examining four distinct search methods: breadth-first search, iterative deepening search, A* search, and weighted A* search with varying alpha weights.

The initial phase involves defining and implementing crucial components such as states, initial states, goal states, and available actions. With these elements established, the next step is to simulate and formalize the problem at hand. This conceptual groundwork serves as the basis for translating the specifications into a practical implementation using classes and nodes. Our algorithms' description hinges on determining the sequence for node exploration and expansion.

Finally, quantitative assessments come into play as we calculate the time durations for each test and algorithm execution. This empirical analysis enables us to discern which algorithm performs more efficiently and effectively in terms of speed and overall quality.
